# Voxel-Sea-Builder-Plugin

A development plugin to help build voxel based environments easily.

Although the worlds don't port over to the Voxel Sea Engine yet, because Voxel Sea doesn't support encoding and decoding like the plugin does, it is a planned feature and will be added soon to the engine, allowing easy creation of full destructible worlds!

Powered by Voxel Sea Engine.
